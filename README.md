# BeamProject

Apache Beam Overview
Apache Beam is an open source, unified model for defining both batch and streaming data-parallel processing pipelines. Using one of the open source Beam SDKs, you build a program that defines the pipeline. The pipeline is then executed by one of Beamâ€™s supported distributed processing back-ends, which include Apache Apex, Apache Flink, Apache Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow.

This project is to demonstrate the ability of creating flexible pipelines with Apache Beam SDK. This project also utilizes beam_nugget which has a library for Apache Kafka as well as Google Cloud Platform SDK.

from google.cloud import pubsub_v1

import apache_beam as beam

from beam_nuggets.io import kafkaio

publish.py - demonstrates the ability to integrate with google pub/sub and Kafka. Please see code snippet below.

For example:
"publisher.publish(pubsub_topic, event_data)"

and

"with beam.Pipeline(options=PipelineOptions()) as p:
notifications = (p | "Creating data" >> beam.Create([('dev_1', '{"device": "0001", status": "healthy"}')]) 
| "Creating data" >> beam.Create([('Kafka:',event_data )]) 
| "Pushing messages to Kafka" >> kafkaio.KafkaProduce(topic='ORIG', servers="localhost:9092")"


process.py or processSlide.py - demonstrates the use of sliding window vs tumbling window then write to Google Pub/Sub 

For example:
"| 'Window' >> beam.WindowInto(window.SlidingWindows(30,10)) | 'Sum values' >> beam.CombinePerKey(sum) # STR_2 , [] 
| 'Encode to byte string' >> beam.Map(encode_byte_string) 
| 'Write to pus sub' >> beam.io.WriteToPubSub(output_topic)"

subscribe.py - demonstrates the use of subscribing from GCP Pub/Sub

For example:
"subscription_path = 'projects/gcp-se/subscriptions/Subscribe2test' subscriber = pubsub_v1.SubscriberClient() subscriber.subscribe(subscription_path, callback=callback)"
